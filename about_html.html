      HTML, short for
      <b>HyperText Markup Language</b>
      , is the standard language used to create and design documents on the
      World Wide Web. It provides the structure and content of web pages by
      using a system of tags and attributes to define elements. These elements
      can include headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more, allowing for
      the creation of rich and interactive web pages. HTML forms the backbone of
      the web, serving as the foundation upon which cascading style sheets (CSS)
      and JavaScript can be added to enhance the visual design and interactivity
      of websites.
      <i>
        Understanding HTML is essential for anyone looking to create content for
        the internet, as it is the fundamental building block of web
        development.
